🧮 Mathematical Formulas Used

Below are all formulas implemented across the application.

1️⃣ Quantity Scaling Formula (Nutrition Calculator & Recipe Builder)

Dataset values are standardized per 100g.

Scaling factor:

scale = total_quantity / 100


Nutrient calculation:

nutrient_value = dataset_value × scale


Used for:

Calories

Protein

Carbs

Fat

Fiber

Sugar

Sodium

2️⃣ Daily Calorie Progress

Progress toward calorie goal:

progress = daily_calories / calorie_goal


Displayed as a capped progress bar (max = 1.0).

3️⃣ Protein Goal Progress
protein_progress = daily_protein / protein_goal


Also displayed as progress bar.

4️⃣ Macro Calorie Contribution

Energy per gram:

Carbohydrates = 4 kcal/g
Protein = 4 kcal/g
Fat = 9 kcal/g


Macro calorie conversion:

carb_calories = daily_carbs × 4
protein_calories = daily_protein × 4
fat_calories = daily_fat × 9


Total macro calories:

total_macro_calories = carb_calories + protein_calories + fat_calories

5️⃣ Macro Percentage Breakdown
carb_percent = (carb_calories / total_macro_calories) × 100
protein_percent = (protein_calories / total_macro_calories) × 100
fat_percent = (fat_calories / total_macro_calories) × 100


Used in:

Macro insight display

Diet quality assessment

6️⃣ Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)

Using simplified Mifflin-St Jeor Equation (Male version):

BMR = (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) − (5 × age) + 5


If female:

BMR = (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) − (5 × age) − 161

7️⃣ Maintenance Calories

Adjusted using activity multiplier:

maintenance_calories = BMR × activity_multiplier


Typical multipliers:

Activity Level	Multiplier
Sedentary	1.2
Lightly Active	1.375
Moderately Active	1.55
Very Active	1.725
Extra Active	1.9
8️⃣ Target Calories Based on Goal

Weight Loss:

target = maintenance − 500


Weight Gain:

target = maintenance + 500


Maintain:

target = maintenance


500 kcal ≈ moderate deficit/surplus.

9️⃣ Surplus / Deficit Calculation
difference = daily_calories − target_calories


If difference > 0 → surplus
If difference < 0 → deficit

🔟 Weight Change Projection (Energy Balance Principle)

Approximate rule:

7700 kcal ≈ 1 kg of fat


Projected weight change:

weight_change_kg = cumulative_calorie_difference / 7700


This is based on energy conservation, not magic.

1️⃣1️⃣ BMI Formula
BMI = weight_kg / (height_m)^2


Height conversion:

height_m = height_cm / 100


BMI Classification:

< 18.5 → Underweight

18.5–24.9 → Normal

25–29.9 → Overweight

≥ 30 → Obese
